I'd have preferred to do more incremental updates, but instead will just batch the progress all into one big update.</p><h3 id="old-walking-treadmill-broke---new-treadmill-acquired">Old walking treadmill broke -&gt; new treadmill acquired!</h3><p>My cheap <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B081JMW6FJ?tag=mgsloan06-20">GoPlus Treadmill</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> broke after only a bit more than a hundred miles, so I bought a used <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/iMovR-ThermoTread-Treadmill-Measures-Standing/dp/B016COFDOA?tag=mgsloan06-20">IMovr ThermoTread <abbr>GT</abbr></a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> on Craigslist, with about 300 miles on it and in pristine condition. Since it's in such good condition and the summer has been hot here in Colorado, so far it has lived indoors. I've been loving it so far<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, a much less constrained walking area and much smoother than the cheap treadmill.</p><h3 id="new-sit-stand-desk-and-active-sitting-stool">New sit-stand desk and active sitting stool</h3><p>My employer kindly purchased equipment for working from home. While I contemplated figuring out some weird ergonomic stuff to get, unfortunately most of the eccentric options I was interested in, like the <a href="https://www.varierfurniture.com/en_us/explore-our-chairs/recline/gravity-balans-r">Varier Gravity Balans</a> or the <a href="https://www.humanscale.com/products/standing-desks/float-table">Humanscale Float desk</a> all fell outside the bounds of both budget and reasonableness. So, instead, I ended up with the following setup:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-setup.jpg" alt="Treadmill desk" width="1280" height="1707"></p><ul><li><p>An electrically actuated sit/stand desk, <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/idasen-sit-stand-underframe-for-table-top-beige-30412165/">Ikea Idasen Sit/Stand Underframe</a>.</p><ul><li><p>I chose this desk because it has a reputation for being very stable even when fully extended, likely partially due to the leg design. This is particularly important for treadmilling, because the desk will be quite high when properly positioned, and the action of walking can tend to create little impulses through the floor and through your palms, which can cause some wobble.</p></li><li><p>I also read that Linak actuators and electronics are quite nice, perhaps superior to the Jiecang actuators found in many popular desks (Uplift, Jarvis, Evodesk, Geekdesk, etc).</p></li><li><p>One thing I particularly like about the Linak electronics is that it supports bluetooth. While the phone control is fairly lobotomized – it requires you to keep pressing on the phone to continue movement – it turns out there is a very handy <a href="https://github.com/rhyst/idasen-controller">idasen-controller script</a> which allows computer control! So now I can get my desk to move to preset heights via keyboard shortcuts. This makes me disproportionately happy :)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I got just the underframe, with the intention of putting a very nice piece of wood on the top. However, I wanted to have a functioning desk quickly after picking up the underframe, and so I got a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Birch-Plywood-Common-3-4-in-x-2-ft-x-4-ft-Actual-0-728-in-x-23-75-in-x-47-75-in-154148/203504324">$30 piece of 4'x2' birch plywood from Home Depot</a>. My woodworking friends tell me the edges could really use some improvements, and maybe finishing it would be good, or adding some birch edge tape, but I am pretty happy with it for now. I think the bare wood looks decent, and since it is was inexpensive I am not as concerned about drilling into it, spills, etc.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://qor360.com/shop/the-ariel-active-chair-qor360/"><abbr>QOR</abbr>360 "Ariel" active office chair</a>, which I enjoy a lot so far. It forces you to use core stabilization to make sitting a bit more active, which prevents slouching. It <em>is</em> possible tilt your pelvis all the way back and round your back a bunch in terrible posture, so it does not entirely prevent bad posture. However, that posture is so extreme that it immediately feels ridiculous and so it is impossible for me to linger in it unaware.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CUW5HDU?tag=mgsloan06-20"><abbr>VIVO</abbr> desk mount stand</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> to raise the screen to a nice height. I got a relatively inexpensive stand instead of a fancy adjustable arm for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>The relative height I desire between the keyboard and screen is fairly constant between postures, since I am always upright.</p></li><li><p>Most monitor arms can't elevate the center of the screen to 30" above the desk surface, but that's where I want it for my proportions.</p></li><li><p>When fully elevated, standing desks can be a bit wobbly, and an articulated monitor arm can amplify this wobble. To me this is mainly a concern when walking on the treadmill, as impulses can travel through the floor or through my palms (although, putting much pressure through the palms should really be avoided!).</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="a-variety-of-postures">A variety of postures</h3><p>This setup supports a variety of postures!</p><p>Walking / standing:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-walking-and-standing.jpg" alt="walking and standing at desk" width="1280" height="1141"></p><p>Leaning / active sitting:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-leaning-and-sitting.jpg" alt="Leaning and sitting at desk" width="1280" height="1137"></p><p>One very nice thing about the <abbr>QOR</abbr>360 chair is that there is an option to not have caster feet, and the base fits perfectly within the width of the treadmill belt, so I can put it directly on top. Similarly, the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Products-Leaning-Portable-Outdoor-Available/dp/B01I2N71Z8?tag=mgsloan06-20">Focal Mogo Stool</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> I use for leaning can be used right on top of the treadmill, so I never need to move the treadmill.</p><h3 id="drink-suspension">Drink suspension</h3><p>You might have noticed something a little strange going on in this picture – there's a mug suspended on the right and a water bottle on the left! The idea is that if your drink is suspended by a rope, accidentally bumping it usually never spills it. It also frees up some desk space!</p><p>On the right, as usual for suspending lightweight things indoors, I am using <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01COUOCG6?tag=mgsloan06-20">adjustable tie-downs</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> with <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P1P6VQ5?tag=mgsloan06-20">adhesive hangers</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>. The adjustable part of the tie-down can then hook directly around the loop built into my <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UTKKYFW?tag=mgsloan06-20">combo coffee mug / french press</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>. It's made by <abbr>GSI</abbr> Outdoors, and so is intended for camping and such, but I use it almost every day. I like the convenience of just having one thing to clean, and the built in suspension loop is great for this purpose.</p><p>On the left, I am using a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B074RRG8SX?tag=mgsloan06-20">ChicoBag Bottle Sling</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>. I particularly got this because it fits 2 liter bottles, which I use for homemade seltzer water. It also nicely fits my <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Hydro-Flask-Water-Bottle-Stainless/dp/B083GBLZVG?tag=mgsloan06-20">40oz Hydro Flask</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>.</p><p><img src="./images/desk-drinking.jpg" alt="Drinking from suspended water bottle / coffee mug" width="1280" height="1140"></p><h3 id="desk-cable-organization">Desk cable organization</h3><p>I put in a silly amount of time organizing the cables. Here's what it looked like before:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-messy-cables-merged.jpg" alt="desk with messy cables" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>What a mess! Here are some pics after organizing:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-tidy-cables.jpg" alt="desk with tidy cables" width="1280" height="861"></p><p>Granted, no longer having the speakers on the desk reduced the number of cables a bit. The "before" pictures were taken a few months ago, as it took me a while to get around to putting up this update.</p><p>And here are some pics of the underside, in case you were curious:</p><p><img src="./images/desk-underside-covered.jpg" alt="underside of desk, cables covered" width="1280" height="960"></p><p><img src="./images/desk-underside-exposed.jpg" alt="underside of desk, cables exposed" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>Here's the stuff involved:</p><ul><li><p>After looking around at different cable management ideas, I came across the idea of using finger ducts, which let you stuff the cables in the box, and have them enter / exit at any of the slots. Most of them are plastic, though, and I wanted something more solid, that screwed into the desk. Happily, I found some metal <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HNMVYD9/?tag=mgsloan06-20">19 inch 1U server rack finger ducts</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> which ended up fitting quite nicely for this application.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5RJ0XY?tag=mgsloan06-20">Screw-in cable tie bases</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>. Many of the cable tie bases out there are adhesive, but I wanted something more solid, so got ones that screw in. I thought I'd use a bunch of these, but I only ended up using one, to hold some charging cables.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NVG25D1?tag=mgsloan06-20">Braided cable sleeve</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> to tidy up the monitor cables / power cables.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UNWOM7W?tag=mgsloan06-20">Electriduct power strip</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> provides three plugs and two <abbr>USB</abbr> power ports. It's fairly decent, I got it because it can be screwed into the bottom of the desk, with the outlets facing horizontally.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/CalDigit-USB-C-Pro-Dock-Thunderbolt/dp/B07VL675DT?tag=mgsloan06-20">CalDigit <abbr>USB</abbr>-C Pro Dock</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, this was a bit of a splurge, but it's very well built and works great (and with Linux!). I particularly got it because it supports 85W of charging, whereas many hubs limit the rate of charge. I also liked the future-proofing of it being thunderbolt, though, admittedly, a plain old <abbr>USB</abbr>-C dock would be sufficient for my usage. I used one packet of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Sugru-Pegamento-moldeable-f%C3%B3rmula-original/dp/B00EU7DBNM?tag=mgsloan06-20">Sugru</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup> to affix it to the bottom of the desk.</p><p><img src="./images/desk-dock.jpg" alt="the dock affixed to underside of desk" width="1280" height="960"></p></li></ul><h2 id="2020-05-25---suspending-keyboard-from-ceiling"><a href="#2020-05-25---suspending-keyboard-from-ceiling"></a>2020-05-25 – suspending keyboard from ceiling!</h2><p>Today I was doing some standing computing (as described in the <a href="/posts/deskless-ergo-wfh#deskless-standing-keyboard">standing keyboard section of the deskless wfh post</a>), when I realized I wanted to be able to take quick inversion breaks (handstands, headstands). Doing these inversions is impeded because I needed to detach my keyboard. Two solutions occurred to me:</p><ol><li><p>Use straps + buckle to allow for quick attachment / detachment.</p></li><li><p>Also suspend the keyboard, so I can just walk up to it and start using it. Since the materials for this were readily at hand, I gave this option a shot! It took less than 5 minutes to set this up, which is a pretty great turnaround from idea to implementation.</p></li></ol><p>Here's the initial implementation, using the same adjustable tie-downs and adhesive hooks described in the <a href="/posts/suspending-laptops/">"Laptop Ceiling Suspension" post</a>:</p><p><img src="./images/kinesis-advantage-suspended-from-ceiling.jpg" alt="photo of indoor suspended kinesis advantage keyboard" width="1280" height="851"></p><p>Here are some closeups on how it's attached:</p><p><img src="./images/kinesis-advantage-suspension-closeup-1.jpg" alt="closeup of back of suspended kinesis advantage keyboard" width="1280" height="853"></p><p><img src="./images/kinesis-advantage-suspension-closeup-2.jpg" alt="closeup of front of suspended kinesis advantage keyboard" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>The same can be done suspending it from branches / even twigs, just using the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01COUOCG6?tag=mgsloan06-20">adjustable tie-downs</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>:</p><p><img src="./images/kinesis-advantage-suspended-from-tree.jpg" alt="photo of a kinesis advantage keyboard suspended from tree" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>Roughly what it looks like in use:</p><p><img src="./images/using-kinesis-advantage-suspended-from-tree.jpg" alt="photo of me using a kinesis advantage keyboard suspended from tree" width="1280" height="853"></p><p>So far I'm liking this a lot! I think there are still some advantages over a stationary mount, because the keyboard still has some movement freedom – I can move side to side / turn a bit. This movement freedom is not quite as much as suspension from pants, but there is the notable benefit that I can immediately walk away from the computer without having a keyboard attached to me!</p><h2 id="2020-05-16---polarizer-glasses-post"><a href="#2020-05-16---polarizer-glasses-post"></a>2020-05-16 – <a href="/posts/polarizer-glasses/">"Polarizer Glasses" post</a></h2><p>Synopsis: I built some variable angle polarizer glasses based on camera optics!</p><h2 id="2020-05-02---laptop-ceiling-suspension-post"><a href="#2020-05-02---laptop-ceiling-suspension-post"></a>2020-05-02 – <a href="/posts/suspending-laptops/">"Laptop Ceiling Suspension" post</a></h2><p>Synopsis: Using adhesive hangers and adjustable tie-downs to suspend laptops.</p><h2 id="2020-04-25---hammock-under-the-deck"><a href="#2020-04-25---hammock-under-the-deck"></a>2020-04-25 – hammock under the deck!</h2><p>I found a rather nice spot under the deck for my <a href="https://dutchwaregear.com/product-category/hammock-gear/hammocks/chameleon/">Dutchware Chameleon backpacking hammock</a>:</p><p><img src="./images/under-deck-hammock-setup-1.jpg" alt="photo of hammock under deck" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>You might notice that there are some hooks hanging down. These are for suspending my laptop screen above my head, for ergonomic supine computing! These hooks are <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01COUOCG6?tag=mgsloan06-20">adjustable tie-downs</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>, attached via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P1P6VQ5?tag=mgsloan06-20">adhesive hangers</a><sup><a href="#affiliate-note">$</a></sup>. The nice thing about these adhesive hangers is that they can be removed without damaging the surface.</p><p>So, this is very similar to the approach of suspending from zip-ties / wire as described in the <a href="/posts/suspending-laptops/">"Laptop Ceiling Suspension" post</a>. However, this was relatively unstable because the front of the body ended up resting on the ridgeline. I discovered that putting the hooks through the zip ties and hooking to the ridgeline added some nice stabilization:</p><p><img src="./images/under-deck-hammock-setup-2.jpg" alt="photo of hammock with laptop suspended above" width="1280" height="960"></p><p>I realize it might be hard to visualize how this works.
